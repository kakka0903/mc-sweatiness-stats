Python script that keeps track of playtime between players on your minecraft server and posts a formatted leaderboard to your discord server. 

The script can for example be scheduled to run every morning with crontab. A new message will only be posted if the contents of the leaderboard has actually changed.

Clone the repository (or download just the script) and run it with python 3.9 or higher. The script uses `argparse` so usage for usage details run with `-h` flag.
